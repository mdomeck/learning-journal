## Code Editors / tools

### How do you choose the right text editor for you? Seems to be a personal decision!
- **Code Completion**: start typing and possible completions show up
- **Syntax Highlighting**: colorizing the text
- **Themes**: helps eye strain and fatigue 
- **Extensions**: don't forget those superpowers!
